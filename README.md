Everything you need to cover GoFaster.io

## What is GoFaster.io?

GoFaster.io is a website performance analytics tool that helps teams track and improve the performance of their websites. 

## How does it work?
We gather performance data from your user's browsers (via a Script you add to your site) and combine that with performance data we gather from our servers, then compile all of that data into insightful performance reports.

We utilize team messaging services like Slack to keep teams informed of your daily performance.

## Why we built GoFaster.io

Great user experiences start from the moment your visitors type in your domain name and press the enter key. If your site doesn't become usable in 2 seconds or less, you're probablly losing valuable customers and revenue. That first impression is critical to every product's user experience.

Slow loading websites is a common problem we've come across with nearly every client project we've worked on. We've come to realize that the root cause of a slow loading website for most teams is simply a lack of awareness. 

Most teams care deeply about performance and their user experience, but lack the tools to measure and report on it effectively.

When we looked around for tools to solve this problem, all we found was expensive enterprise-focused solutions that bombard you with every metric under the sun.

We did what any willing and able team would do and set out to solve the problem our way and built gofaster.io for the benefit of our clients, our customers, and ourselves.

## When was GoFaster.io first launched?
We quietly launched in October of 2016 to a group of beta testers, and publically launched in Janurary of 2017.
